# Fluid-Simulation
We first develop a simple particle renderer with controls. We then attempt to use a particle-based approach to simulate water. The key to simulating any fluid is enforcing incompressibility. Unfortunately, this is computationally expensive. In the paper Position Based Fluids, Muller and Macklin describe a method for simulating fluids in a relatively efficient manner while not requiring impractical timesteps. We attempt to implement the various ideas in this paper such as enforcing incompressibility by incorporating density constraints into Position Based Dynamics, simulating surface tension by adding artificial pressure, and reducing damping by adding vorticity confinement and viscosity.
