<h2 align="middle">Abstract</h2>
<p>
  In this project we put the skills we have learned in CS184 to use. We first develop a simple
  particle renderer with controls. We then attempt to use a particle-based approach to simulate water.
  The key to simulating any fluid is enforcing incompressibility. Unfortunately, this is
  computationally expensive. In the paper
  <a href="http://mmacklin.com/pbf_sig_preprint.pdf">Position Based Fluids</a>,
  Muller and Macklin describe a method for simulating fluids in a relatively efficient
  manner while not requiring impractical timesteps. We attempt to implement the
  various ideas in this paper such as enforcing incompressibility by incorporating
  density constraints into Position Based Dynamics, simulating surface tension by adding
  artificial pressure, and reducing damping by adding vorticity confinement and viscosity.
</p>


<h2 align="middle"> Technical Approach</h2>

<h3>Particle Renderer</h3>
<p>
  Before we could simulate anything, we needed something to view our results on. We
  followed the excellent tutorials on <a href="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org">opengl-tutorial.org</a>
  and learned how to use openGL to create a window and render objects. We then tailored
  this to our need in order to render our particles that would eventually simulate
  water.

  </table>
</div>


<h3>Controls</h3>
<p>
  We now wanted a way to navigate our space. Thankfully, the
  <a href="http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__input.html">GLFW Library</a> provides
  plenty of functions to get user input. We decided to go with FPS like controls and so
  the arrow keys allow the camera to strafe in the respective direction and moving the
  mouse affects the direction in which the camera is pointed. We now have a convenient
  way of viewing our particles from any point of view that we like.

<h3>Water Simulation</h3>
<p>
  Now that we have a basic particle renderer and a way to navigate, let's add some
  action to our particles!
</p>
<h4>Pseudocode</h4>
<p>
  As previously mentioned, we follow the technique described by Macklin and Muller in
  the Position Based Fluids Paper (linked above). From a high level, the algorithm
  is as follows:
</p>
</p>
<div align="center">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td align="middle">
      <img src="code.png" width="400"/>
      <figcaption align="middle">PBF Pseudocode</figcaption>
    </tr>

</div>

<h4>Predict Positions and Apply Forces</h4>
<p>
  The first part of nearly any physically based simulation is of course to apply
  external forces. For this part the only external forces acting on our particles
  is gravity. We then do the classic update of the velocity as v = v + a * deltaT and update
  position as x = x + v * deltaT. We used a constant deltaT of 1/60. This caused the real time
  rendering, of course, to be out of sync and look unrealistic. In order to achieve the
  realistic time we simply output an image each time step and then create a video from
  these images with 60 FPS.
</p>
<p>
  Here is our simulation so far with just external forces applied:

  Particles falling due to gravity
</div>

<h4>Finding Neighbors</h4>
The next step in the algorithm is to find a particles neighbors. In order to do this,
we implement a similar technique to the one in our cloth simulation. We first divide
our space into an evenly spaced grid. We decided to break the space into boxes
with width, height, and depth equal to 1.5 times the radius of our particles. We then
hash each particle based on which box it falls into. One key difference from the cloth
simulation is that instead of considering only particles in the same box neighbors, we
search the 27 surrounding boxes for neighbors as well. This is because we would
like a more accurate count of neighbors so we can get a more accurate estimation
of density in the next part. Thus we go through all the boxes mentioned above and add a
particle j to particle i's list of neighbors if j is within radius*1.5 of i.
</p>
<p>
  Below we visualize one particles neighbors. The particle we are looking at is in red,
  and its neighbors are white.

<h4>Enforcing Incompressibility</h4>
<p>
  The main bulk of simulating fluids, and thus the main bulk of the paper, is
  maintaining constant density, or enforcing incompressibility. In other words,
  for each time step, we want to move the particles such that the density around
  each particle is as close to the rest density as possible.
</p>
<p>
  Obviously, the first thing we need is a way to estimate the density. Now that we
  have each particles' neighbors, this can be done using the SPH Density estimator.
  We define the density for the ith particle as:
</p>
<center>
  $$\rho_i = \sum_j m_j W(p_i - p_j, h)$$
</center>
<p>
  Where $W(r,h)$ is a smoothing kernel. To be consistent with the paper we used the
  Poly6 Kernel for the non-gradient calculations and the Spiky Kernel for the gradient
  calculations. One small note is that we give all particles an equal mass so we drop the $m_j$ term
  in the above calculation.
</p>
<p>
  We can now express our desire for a constant density as a mathematical constraint.
  Thus, we define a constraint function for each particle, where the constraint
  for the ith particle is:
</p>
<center>
  $$C_i(p_1, .., p_n) = \frac{\rho_i}{\rho_0} - 1$$
</center>
<p>
  Where $\rho_0$ is the rest density and $p_1, ..., p_n$ denotes the position
  of the ith particle and all of its neighbors.
</p>

<h5>A Quick Aside On Position Based Dynamics</h5>
<p>
  As was previously mentioned, Particle Based Fluids works by incorporating the
  density constraint into the Particle Based Dynamics method. PBD works by looking
  for a correction to the positions such that the constraint function is zero. In other
  words, PBD seeks a $\Delta p$ such that:
  <center>
    $$ C(p + \Delta p) = 0 $$
  </center>
  It does so by a series of Newton steps along the constraint gradient. In other words:
  <center>
    $$ \Delta p \approx \nabla C(p)\lambda $$
    $$ C(p + \Delta p) \approx C(p) + \nabla C^T \Delta p = 0 $$
    $$ C(p + \Delta p) \approx C(p) + \nabla C^T \nabla C(p) \lambda = 0 $$
    $$ \lambda = - C(p)(\nabla C^T \nabla C(p))^{-1} $$
  </center>

  <h5>Back to Position Based Fluids</h5>
  For position based fluids, we simply use our density constraint function as $C$ and get:
  <center>
    $$ \lambda_i = - \frac{C(p_1, ..., p_n)}{\sum_k |\nabla_{p_k} C_i|^2} $$
  </center>
  In order to prevent numerical instability in the denominator, we use Constraint Force Mixing,
  which mixes some of the constraint force back in to the constraint. The result ends up being
  that we add some constant value $\epsilon$ to the denominator and so our final lambda calculation
  for the ith particle becomes:
  <center>
    $$ \lambda_i = - \frac{C(p_1, ..., p_n)}{\sum_k |\nabla_{p_k} C_i|^2 + \epsilon} $$
  </center>
</p>
<p>
  Now recall that $\Delta p = \nabla C(p) \lambda$. We have now solved for everything we
  need to in order to calculate $\Delta p$, which is the change in postition such that the constraint
  function equals zero. In our case, this means we now can calulate the change in each particle's
  position such that its density is about the same as our rest density! For each particle i,
  the total number of corrections is:
  <center>
    $$ \Delta p_i = \frac{1}{\rho0} \sum_j (\lambda_i + \lambda_j) \nabla W(p_i - p_j, h) $$
  </center>
</p>
<p>
  At this point, using the above position update rule we ge the following:

<h4>Update Velocity with Vorticity Confinement and XSPH Viscosity</h4>
<p>
  In the above video, we get good results, but the movement is very dampened. This is a side
  effect of using Position Based Dynamics. One way to fix this is to increase the
  number of iterations but this quickly becomes unreasonable. A better solution is the
  one used in the Position Based Fluids paper which is to
  add vorticity confinement and viscosity to our simulation.
</p>
<p> Vorticity is the measurement of spin and rotation in a fluid. It can be observed by watching particles' relative displacements when they move along the flow. We added the vorticity by applying a corrective force. We estimated the vorticity of a particle followed by the equation from the paper:
  <center>
    $$ w_i = \sum_j v_{ij} \times \nabla_{p_j} W(p_i - p_j, h) $$
  </center>
where $$ v_{ij} = v_j - v_i $$ the difference between the current particle's velocity and the velocity of its neighbor particles. We can then calculate the corrective force using below equation:
  <center>
    $$ f^{vorticity}_i = \epsilon (N \times w_i) $$
  </center>
where $N$ is:
<center>
$$ N = \frac{\nabla_{|w|_i}}{|\nabla_{|w|_i}|} $$
</center>
</p>

<p> We also apply viscosity to our water to reflect the "thickness" of the fluid. Similar to the shearing force from the cloth simulation, fluid also have shearing force. Viscosity is the force which fluid resists that distortion. Thick fluid has high viscosity, thin fluid like water has low viscosity. So water particles appear to not stick compared to oil particles. We can do so by updating the particle's velocity as:
</p>
<center>
  $$ v^{new}_i = v_i + c \sum_j v_{ij} * W(p_i - p_j, h) $$
</center>
<p>
  Adding the vorticity confinement and viscocity to our simulation gives us the following:
</p>

  </video>
  <br>
</div>
<p>
  As we can see, the fluid is much more...fluid. Less damping occurs, we get nicer
  splashes, and the fluid rebounds and  "sloshes" in a manner more similar to real
  water.
</p>



<h4>Improving visuals with "foam"</h4>
<p> We originally had all the particles appear as blue. We think it is better to have the particles with higher velocity to appear in whiter colors so the fluid looks more like foam. In order to change the particles' colors according to their velocities. We followed the equation from the original report:
</p>
<center>
  $$ c = 1 - (\frac{1}{v^2_x + v^2_y + v^2_z})^2 $$
</center>
 $c$ represents the whiteness of the particles' color. So the higher the velocity, the bigger the c is. We maintain c as a positive value by capping it between 0 and 1. We used HSL to get the updated color and converted it back to RGB and applied it to the particles.
 </p>
<p>
  This was the last touch and we now get our final result:

<h4>Problems Encountered and Lessons Learned</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Don't underestimate the basics. We originally allocated virtually no time in
    our schedule plan for developing the basic renderer. However, this proved to
    take much more time than we expected to get everything working.
  </li>
  <li>
    Timing is everything. In an effort to lock our simulation in with real time,
  we originally calculated $\Delta t$ each iteration using the true difference
in time since the last iteration. Early on this seemed fine. However, as our simulation
grew more complex we began getting strange results. We eventually realized, after visiting
office hours (thanks Kevin!), that our timestep was too small and this was causing problems.
We changed our $\Delta t$ to a constant 1/60 and things returned to normal.
  </li>
  <li>
    Small tweaks in parameters can make a huge difference. As one can see, this
    simulation method has many tweakable parameters. Lambda relaxation parameter,
    rest density, particle radius, vorticity epsilon, viscosity constant, etc. We
    originally underestimated how important these parameters were and so after we initially
    implemented the algorithm we were not getting good results. Again, after visiting
    OH we were told that these parameters were important and we should spend time
    carefully tweaking them to perfection. In doing this we realized how important and  sensitive
     they were. For example, a change of 0.1 in the vorticity epsilon could make the difference
     between a great simulation and a completely out of control one.
